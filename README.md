# EXERCISE CONTENT

This is an example version of a simple app for the MSI internal JS/Angular training, Angular part.

# Steps: 
1. Set up a project using Angular CLI
2. Fill the main component with dummy data
3. Fetch images using this endpoint: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/albums/1/photos?_limit=10 
4. Create a responsive image grid
5. Create a directive for lazy loading images asynchronously 
6. Plug the directive into the image grid
7. (Optional) Write unit tests
8. Actually, it's not optional. Test your code. Especially JavaScript. 

# Notes: 

Use TypeScript typings (TSLint not mandatory here)  
Use services for component-nonspecific behaviours  
Use [Observables](https://angular.io/guide/rx-library)  
Make the directive as universal as possible
